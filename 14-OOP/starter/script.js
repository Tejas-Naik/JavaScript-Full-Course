What is OOP?
- OOP is a programming paradigm(style) based on concept of objects.
- We use ibjects to model (describe) real-world or abstract features.
- Objects may contain data(properties) and code(methods).
- in OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code.
- Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another
- Interactions happen through a public interface (API): methods that the code
-   outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object.
- OOP was developed with goal to maintain the code. for more flexibility.

- Objects that are created in OOP are called Classes.
- Classes are blueprints for new objects
- we can create as many objects possible with the bluprint (instances).

How do we design Classes?
- We can create Classes using these 4 fundamental principles
    1. Abstraction
            --> Ignoring and Hiding details that doesnt matter. (High Overview of a function/class).
    2. Encapsulation
            --> Keeping some properties private, they cant be accessed by outside.
    3. Inheritance
            --> Inheritence is the way of making all properties/methods of a class get inherited by other child classes.
            --> Creating new classes from the original one
    4. Polymorphism
            --> Modifying/changing the inherited class's method
            --> (Parent[login-method]) --> Child[login-method] - new login method.
