/*
Overview of Modern JS
DEVELOPMENT: ( (ex: NPM, Node)
    - We dont write all the code in one file
    - We separate them by modules
    - One special thing about these are we can use third-party packages too
    -- Third-Party packages come form NPM(Node Package Manager).
)

BUILD PROCESS: ( (ex: webpack, Parcel)
    BUNDLING : join all modules into one file.
    TRANSPILING / POLYFING : convert modern JS to ES5. (using BABEL).
)

PRODUCTION: (
    - We dont put these modules into the production
    - We create a JS Bundle at the end of the development phase.
