Overview of Modern JS
DEVELOPMENT: ( (ex: NPM, Node)
    - We dont write all the code in one file
    - We separate them by modules
    - One special thing about these are we can use third-party packages too
    -- Third-Party packages come form NPM(Node Package Manager).
)

BUILD PROCESS: ( (ex: webpack, Parcel)
    BUNDLING : join all modules into one file.
    TRANSPILING / POLYFING : convert modern JS to ES5. (using BABEL).
)

PRODUCTION: (
    - We dont put these modules into the production
    - We create a JS Bundle at the end of the development phase.    
)


MODULES IN JS
- reusable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details.
- Standalone file (w/ import , export)
- Modules stored in file (one module per file)

                                    ES6                             Script
1. Top level variables              Scoped to Module                Global scope
2. Default mode                     Strict mode                     Sloppy mode
3. `this` keyword                   undefined                       window
4. Imports & Exports                Yes                             No
(imports are hoisted (executed at the top of the file)).
5. HTML Linking                     <script type="module">          <script>
6. File downloading                 Asynchronous                    Synchronous

Imports and Exports
- Imports happen first(top) of the code.
- First the imported code executes
- You cannot use the variables declares in the module directly in the other modules you have to export them

Exports;
- 2 types of Exports
-- Default Exports
-- Named Exports

How to Use NPM
1. NPM Init (get the package.json)
2. install the dependencies
3. add node_modules/* to gitignore
4. push it to git 
5. npm i to install all the dependencies
