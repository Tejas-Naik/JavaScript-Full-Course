MVC Model (Model view Controller).
Why worry about architecture?
- Structure
- Maintanability
- Expandibility

create your own architecture if possible (small apps)
otherwise, use well defined architectures from software developers
- MVC, MVP(presenter), Flux, etc...

COMPONENTS OF ANY ARCHITECTURE:
1. Business Logic
-- Solves the actual business problem
-- sending messages, storing transactions, calculating taxes

2. State (redux)
-- stores all the data about the application
-- should be the "single source of truth"
-- UI sync w/ state
-- state libraries exist

3. HTTP Library
-- recieving AJAX calls
-- optional but necessary

4. Application Logic(router)
-- implementation of the application itself
-- Handles navigation and UI events

5. Presentation Logic(UI Layer)
-- visible part of the application
-- Displays application state (UI)
